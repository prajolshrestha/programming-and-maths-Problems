"""
1. Python Environment (Interpreter):  Python interpreter that executes Python code.
                                      Python environments can vary based on the Python version and the installed packages. 
                                      You can have multiple Python environments on your system . 

2. Development Environment:  It includes text editors or integrated development environments (IDEs), 
                             version control systems, and debugging tools.

3. Execution Environment: It is where Python code runs.
                            - For web applications, the execution environment might be a web server 
                              that runs Python using a web framework like Django or Flask.
                            - In scientific computing, the execution environment can be a Jupyter Notebook 
                              or a specialized environment like Anaconda.
                            - In automation scripts, Python code might run in a terminal or as part of a batch job.

4. Virtual Environment: It allow you to create isolated Python environments for different projects to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.
                            (e.g., virtualenv or Python's built-in venv)

5. System Environment Variables: are variables that can be accessed by Python code to retrieve system-level information or configuration settings.

                                - For example, you can use os.environ to access environment variables like PATH or user-defined variables.

6. Deployment Environment: 
                        - When deploying Python applications, 
                          you have various environments such as development, testing, staging, and production. 
                          Each environment may have different configurations, databases, and security settings.
                        
                        -Tools like Docker and container orchestration platforms help manage deployment environments 
                         and ensure consistent deployment across different stages of development.
