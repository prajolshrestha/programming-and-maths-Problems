    msg db "Hello, world!", 0x0a    ; created a string of bytes named msg, which has helloworld followed by 0x0a, ie 10, code for new line 
    len equ $ - msg                 ; determining length of the string (by sub loc of start of the string from the location after the string)
                                    ; we could inline the length as an integer which is 14 in this case
                                    ;But, doing like our code , allows us to change the string without having to count and update the length manually
