# CUDA Matrix Multiplication Implementations

This repository contains different implementations of matrix multiplication using CUDA, showcasing various optimization techniques.

## Implementations Overview

### 1. Basic Implementation (01matrix_mul.cu)
- Simple row-column multiplication
- One thread computes one element of output matrix
- Memory access pattern is not optimized
- Performance: Baseline (1x)
- Best for: Learning and understanding basic CUDA concepts

### 2. Cache Tiled Implementation (02cache_tiled_matrix_mul.cu)
- Uses shared memory for tiling
- Reduces global memory access
- Block size: 16x16
- Performance: ~2-3x faster than basic
- Best for: Medium-sized matrices with limited resources

### 3. Aligned Implementation (03alignment_matrix.cu)
- Matrix transposition for coalesced memory access
- Changed indexing pattern for better memory alignment
- Performance: ~1.5-2x faster than basic
- Best for: When memory bandwidth is the bottleneck

### 4. cuBLAS Implementation (04cublas_matmul.cu)
- Uses NVIDIA's optimized BLAS library
- Highly optimized for different GPU architectures
- Performance: ~5-10x faster than basic
- Best for: Production environments and large matrices

## Modern Advanced Techniques

### 1. Tensor Cores
- Available on Volta, Turing, and newer architectures
- Uses mixed-precision computation
- Performance: Up to 125 TFLOPS (A100 GPU)
- Best for: AI/ML workloads and when FP16/BF16 precision is acceptable

### 2. Multi-GPU Implementation
- Distributes work across multiple GPUs
- Uses NCCL for efficient communication
- Performance: Near-linear scaling with GPU count
- Best for: Very large matrices and multi-GPU systems

### 3. CUTLASS Library
- Template library for custom matrix computations
- Supports mixed precision and complex layouts
- Performance: Similar to cuBLAS with more flexibility
- Best for: Custom data types and specialized algorithms

### 4. Hierarchical Block-Based Algorithm
- Multiple levels of tiling (registers, shared memory, L2)
- Optimized thread cooperation
- Performance: ~3-4x faster than basic tiled
- Best for: When custom control over optimization is needed

## Performance Comparison (1024x1024 Matrix)
1. Basic Implementation: 1x (baseline)
2. Cache Tiled: 2.8x faster
3. Aligned: 1.8x faster
4. cuBLAS: 8.5x faster
5. Tensor Cores: 15-20x faster (on supported hardware)
