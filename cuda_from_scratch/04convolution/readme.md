# CUDA Convolution Implementations

This directory contains different implementations of parallel convolution in CUDA, demonstrating various optimization techniques.

## Implementations Overview

### 1. Basic Version (01_naive_1D_conv.cu)
- Basic parallel implementation with one thread per output element
- Uses global memory for array, mask, and result storage
- Implements boundary checking for each element
- Handles mask radius calculation dynamically
- Simple kernel implementation with direct memory access
- Requires three separate device memory allocations (array, mask, result)
- Suitable for learning and baseline comparison

### 2. Constant Memory Version (02_1D_conv_with_constant_memory.cu)
- Stores fixed-size convolution mask (MASK_LENGTH=7) in constant memory
- Uses cudaMemcpyToSymbol for efficient mask loading
- Reduces global memory traffic for mask access
- Requires only two device memory allocations (array and result)
- Implements same boundary checking as naive version
- Better performance due to constant memory caching of mask
- Fixed mask size at compile time using #define

### 3. Shared Memory with Constant Memory Version (03_tiled_1D_conv.cu)
- Utilizes shared memory to store elements needed for computation
- Employs constant memory for storing the convolution mask
- Reduces global memory access by loading data into shared memory
- Handles halo elements to avoid divergence
- Zero-padded input array for boundary handling
- Suitable for small to medium kernel sizes

### 4. Cache Simplification (04_1D_conv_cache_simplification.cu)
- Simplifies cache usage by leveraging shared memory
- Uses constant memory for the convolution mask
- Reduces divergence by selectively accessing shared memory or global memory
- Zero-padded input array for boundary handling
- Optimizes memory access patterns for better performance
- Suitable for small to medium kernel sizes

### 5. 2D Convolution Version (05_2D_conv.cu)
- Implements 2D convolution with constant memory for mask storage
- Uses fixed 7x7 mask size defined at compile time
- 2D thread block and grid organization (16x16 threads per block)
- Efficient boundary handling for both rows and columns
- Thread coordinates calculated using blockIdx and threadIdx
- Single global memory load per matrix element
- Suitable for image processing applications
- Optimized memory access patterns with 2D indexing
